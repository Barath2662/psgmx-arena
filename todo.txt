Im planning to remove email as login details. only username and name is enough. user name is same as register number. these are for student data. admin data is same as the email and name. admin mail id: barathvikramansk@gmail.com.
leave the default password as register number. the example format of register number is 25MX103. Two numbers, followed by MX and 3 numbers. but for admin the same as I gave previously. mailid, name, default password is admin@123. When the admin is added the password shiuld be this. for instructor default password is instruct@123. No remove all the data in db and push the new data(only barathvikramansk@gmail.com, name: BarathVikraman S K, DEFAULt passsowrd). only push this now, remove other data in it.
